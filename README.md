# Simulation-and-Load-Flow-Study-of-a-5-bus-power-system-
1. Perform load flow studies of the power system of Fig. 1 to identify slack bus (Bus no. 
1) power and bus voltages (Bus no. 2 to Bus no. 3). Compute line flows and line 
losses also. [Use ETAP simulation software] 
2. Verify the results obtained in Task no. 1 by writing a Matlab code adopting any load 
flow analysis method. 
3. Make an under voltage event in Bus-4 and apply any technique to overcome the under 
voltage problem of the system. (Consider, below 85% to be undervoltage for any bus) 
. 
4. Initiate an unsymmetrical fault (L-G, L-L-G, L-L) in the transmission lines. Group-1 
initiate fault in line 1-3, Group-2 initiate fault in line 2-3, Group-3 initiate fault in line 
2-4 and Group-4 initiate fault in line 2-5. Observe the change in the results of the load 
flow studies after the fault initiation.
